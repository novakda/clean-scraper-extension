## Project Structure
This is a browser extension built with WXT and Vue. WXT provides a modern development experience for building browser extensions with hot reloading and TypeScript support.

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
pnpm dev              # Start dev server (Chrome)
pnpm dev:firefox      # Start dev server (Firefox)
```

### Building
```bash
pnpm build            # Build for Chrome
pnpm build:firefox    # Build for Firefox
pnpm zip              # Build and zip for Chrome
pnpm zip:firefox      # Build and zip for Firefox
```

### Type Checking
```bash
pnpm compile          # Run vue-tsc type check
```

### Installation
```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies (run after cloning)
```

## Harness Commands

### Session Startup
- `/harness-start` - Start a new harness session, view status and sync issues
- `init.sh` - Initialize dev environment and show current state

### Feature Management
- `/harness-feature` - Add new features to track (creates GitHub issues if configured)
- `/harness-orchestrate` - Orchestrate multi-agent teams for complex features
- `/harness-checkpoint` - Save session progress, commit/push, create/update PR
- `/harness-merge-all` - Merge all PRs, close issues, delete branches

### Progress Tracking
Progress is tracked in:
- `feature-list.json` - Active features being worked on
- `feature-archive.json` - Completed features (auto-populated on checkpoint)
- `claude-progress.json` - Session continuity and environment state
- `agent-context.json` - Multi-agent orchestration shared context
- `agent-memory.json` - Multi-agent orchestration persistent memory

## WXT Specific Notes

### Entry Points
WXT auto-discovers entry points from:
- `entrypoints/` directory (main, background, content scripts, options, popup)

### Manifest Configuration
Manifest is configured in `wxt.config.ts` and auto-generated by WXT.

### Browser APIs
WXT provides type-safe access to browser APIs through their utility functions.

### Storage
Use `@wxt-dev/storage` (already in dependencies) for cross-browser storage.
